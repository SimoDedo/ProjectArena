--- NOTES ---

To change pages numbering use \pagenumbering{?}:
	gobble - no numbers
	arabic - arabic numbers
	roman - roman numbers

To have sections use \section{}, \subsection{}, \subsubsection{}.
To have paragraphs use \paragraph{}, \subparagraph{}.

To have equations without index use \usepackage{amsmath} with \begin{equation*} and end{equation*}

To force the position of an image use \usepackage{float} with:
    h (here) - same location
    t (top) - top of page
    b (bottom) - bottom of page
    p (page) - on an extra page
    ! (override) - will force the specified location
	
--- STRUCTURE ---

A document has a preamble and document part
The document environment must be defined
Commands beginning with a backslash \, environments have a begin and end tag
Useful settings for pagenumbering:
	gobble - no numbers
	arabic - arabic numbers
	roman - roman numbers

--- SECTIONS ---

LaTeX uses the commands \section, \subsection and \subsubsection to define sections in your document
The sections will have successive numbers and appear in the table of contents
Paragraphs are not numbered and thus don't appear in the table of contents

--- PACKAGES ---

Packages add new functions to LaTeX
All packages must be included in the preamble
Packages add features such as support for pictures, links and bibliography

--- MATH ---

LaTeX is a powerful tool to typeset math
Embed formulas in your text by surrounding them with dollar signs $
The equation environment is used to typeset one formula
The align environment will align formulas at the ampersand & symbol
Single formulas must be seperated with two backslashes \\
Use the matrix environment to typeset matrices
Scale parentheses with \left( \right) automatically
All mathematical expressions have a unique command with unique syntax
Notable examples are:
	\int^a_b for integral symbol
	\frac{u}{v} for fractions
	\sqrt{x} for square roots
Characters for the greek alphabet and other mathematical symbols such as \lambda
	
--- PICTURES ---

Use the graphicx package and figure environment to embed pictures
Pictures will be numbered automatically
Change the width of your image by using \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{}
Refer to pictures in your document by setting a \label and using the \ref tag
Set the position of your image by adding a float option such as [h!]
If you want to show multiple figures next to each other, use the subcaption package and the subfigure environment

--- TABLE OF CONTENT ---

Autogenerate a table of content using \tableofcontents
Create lists of your figures and tables with \listoffigures and \listoftables
Always compile twice to see the changes
Globally change the depth with \setcounter{tocdepth}{X}; X = {1,2,3,4,5}
For single sections use \addtocontents{toc}{\setcounter{tocdepth}{X}} instead

--- BIBLIOGRAPHY ---

Generate a bibliography with BibTeX and BibLaTeX
First define a .bib file using: \bibliography{BIB_FILE_NAME} (do not add .bib)
For BibTeX put the \bibliography statement in your document, for BibLaTeX in the preamble
BibTeX uses the \bibliographystyle command to set the citation style
BibLaTeX chooses the style as an option like: \usepackage[backend=bibtex, style=verbose-trad2]{biblatex}
BibTeX uses the \cite command, while BibLaTeX uses the \autocite command
The \autocite command takes the page number as an option: \autocite[NUM]{}

--- FOOTNOTES ---

Create footnotes with the \footnote command and label them with \label
Make sure that the label is contained within the braces of the footnote command
Use the \ref command to refer to footnotes

--- TABLES ---

LaTeX offers the table and tabular environment for table creation
The table environment acts like a wrapper for the tabular similar to the figure environment
Alignment and vertical separators are passed as an argument to the tabular environment (e.g. \begin{tabular}{l|c||r})
It's possible to align the content left (l), centered (c) and right (r), where the number of alignment operators has to match the desired number of columns
The columns can be seperated by adding | in between the alignment operators
Rows can be seperated using the \hline command and columns using the ampersand & symbol
The newline \\ operator indicates the end of a row
It's possible to refer to tables using \ref and \label
Align numbers at the decimal point using the siunitx package
Combine multiple rows and columns with the multirow package
Prettify your tables using the booktabs package
Make your tables span multiple pages with the longtable package
Display your tables in landscape using the rotating package

--- CSV TABLES ---

LaTeX can generate tables from .csv files automatically
Copy and paste the above snippet and packages to get it to work hassle free
To add new columns, simply duplicate the display column line and change the number and name
Add new units using the \siunitx command and the ampersand seperator as shown above
Have a .csv file seperated with comma as column seperator and newline as row seperator
Does only work for tables smaller than one page

--- PLOTS ---

Plotting is easy with pgfplots, it plots data directly from .csv files
Select a column by the actual name from the .csv file using table[x=column 1,y=column 2â€¦

--- HYPERLINKS ---

Add the hyperref package to your preamble
Links will show up in a colored box which will be invisible when you print it.
Use \href{URL}{DESCRIPTION} to add a link with description
Use \url{URL} to add a link without a description
Prepend your email address with mailto: to make it clickable and open your mail program.
In case you want to customize the appearance, read the documentation on ctan

--- LISTS ---

Unordered lists can be created using the itemize environment.
Ordered lists can be created using the enumerate environment.
Lists can be nested and will be aligned and enumerated properly.
Use the enumitem package to customize the symbols or enumeration.

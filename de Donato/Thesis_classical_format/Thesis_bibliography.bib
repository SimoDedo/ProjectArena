	abstract = {Dungeon generation is among the oldest problems in procedural content generation. Creating the spatial aspects of a dungeon requires three steps: random generation of rooms and sizes, placement of these rooms inside a fixed area, and connecting rooms with passageways. This paper uses a series of integer linear constraints, solved by a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver, to perform the placement step. Separation constraints ensure dungeon rooms do not intersect and maintain a minimum fixed separation. Designers can specify control lines, and dungeon rooms will be placed within a fixed distance of these control lines. Generation times vary with number of rooms and constraints, but are often very fast. Spatial distribution of solutions tend to have hot spots, but is surprisingly uniform given the underlying complexity of the solver. The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of a declarative approach to dungeon layout generation, where designers can express desired intent, and the SMT solver satisfies this if possible.},

	abstract = {Basing itself on a theoretical discussion and experiments, this paper outlines the basic spatial principles of level design in multi-player first-person shooters with special reference to Counter-Strike (Sierra). In this manner, the paper seeks to outline a heuristics of level design in firstperson shooters. The thesis of the paper is that a consistent examination of a game's gameplay, its agents, and spatial components is necessary for the development of a design method that will lead to ultimate level design.Setting off from a theoretical discussion of the terms gameplay and emergence, the paper starts by establishing some basic characteristics of multiplayer shooters. The concept of emergence leads to a distinction of the unique features of multi-play and teamplay, and notions of gameplay help us to map out the basic spatial properties of the game environment and its staging of player strategies and tactical choice. The key concept in the principles of spatiality in level design advanced here is the socalled collision point; the location that marks the clash of players and hence by the set of relevant tactical choices to be made by the teams.To demonstrate the empirical basis and possible application in practical level design, the paper provides an analysis of a design and a re-design of a Counter-Strike map (de\_type). These experiments demonstrate the pros and cons of various design solutions and point at the basic spatial principles referred to above.The paper affirms that it does make sense to regard level design as tool for controlling the gameplay and the game's progression. Also it affirms that it is possible by means of a critical and systematical approach to distinguish between good and bad level-design. Thus a set of heuristics is suggested as a set of guidelines that could lead to better level-design for practitioners.},

In order to improve players’ game experiences, game designers need to understand players’ behavioral tendencies and create levels accordingly. Among various components of levels, this paper targets mazes and presents an automatic maze generation method considering difficulty based on human players’ tendencies. We first investigate the tendencies using supervised learning and then create a test player considering human-likeness by exploiting the tendencies. The test player simulates human players’ behaviors when playing mazes and judges difficulty according to the simulation results. Maze evaluation results from subject experiments show that our method succeeds in generating mazes where the difficulty estimated by the test player matches human players’.},

In particular, we present a methodology to evolve maps for Cube 2: Saubertran, an open source first person shooter, and to improve the game balancing for specific combinations of players skills and strategies. We tested our approach on three different scenarios that involve players with different skill levels as well as players using completely different weapons. Our results are very promising and show that, in all the scenarios considered, our approach is able to evolve maps that result in a balanced game experience.},

Our genetic algorithm determines how "good" a candidate level is by examining many different properties of the level, all based on its static aspects. Once the genetic algorithm identifies a good candidate, simulations are performed to evaluate the dynamic aspects of the level. Levels that are statically good may not be dynamically good (or even solvable), making simulation an essential aspect of our level generation system. By carefully optimizing our genetic algorithm and simulation agent we have created an efficient system capable of generating interesting levels in real time.},

	abstract = {This study presents a system for automatically producing puzzles for use in game design. The system incorporates an evolutionary algorithm that optimizes the puzzle to a specified level of difficulty. The fitness function uses dynamic programming to compute the minimum number of moves required to solve a puzzle. Two types of puzzle are explored, one is a maze based on chess pieces and the other uses colors as related by the color wheel to create an implicit maze. The evolutionary algorithm is able to produce a wide variety of puzzles at specified levels of difficulty. The algorithm can thus be used to provides a library for game design or for variable game content. The technique is flexible and can be generalized to puzzles of remarkable complexity by simply upgrading the dynamic programming algorithm used in the fitness function. It is found that puzzles requiring a maximum number of moves to solve are, potentially, less difficult because such puzzles present the player with few choices. This problem is addressed by modifying the algorithm to search for puzzles with a smaller minimum number of moves required, leaving more room in the puzzle for choice and its attendant confusion.},

In order to verify whether the generated maze can retain the original Pac-Man style or not, we evaluate the appearance of the maze by the esthetic score based on distributions and sizes of various attributes in the generated maze and the original maze. We have divided the generated mazes into nine different difficulty levels, and for each difficulty level, the maze can nearly be generated in 40ms and it is playable!

	abstract = {A correctly designed dynamic programming algorithm can be used as a fitness function to permit the evolution of maze-like levels for use in games. This study compares multiple representations for evolvable mazes including direct, as well as positive and negative indirect representations. The first direct representation simply specifies, with a binary gene, which squares of a grid are obstructed. The second paints the maze grid and passage is allowed only between colors that are the same or adjacent in a rainbow. The positive and negative representations are developmental and evolve directions for adding barriers or digging “tunnels.” These representations are tested with a design space of fitness functions that automatically generate levels with controllable properties. Fitness function design is the most difficult part of automatic level generation and this study gives a simple framework for designing fitness functions that permits substantial control over the character of the mazes that evolve. This technique relies on using checkpoints within the maze to characterize the connectivity and path lengths within the level. Called checkpoint-based fitness, these fitness functions are built on a menu of properties that can be rewarded. The choice of which qualities are rewarded, in turn, specifies within broad limits the characteristics of the mazes to be evolved. Three of the representations are found to benefit from a technique called sparse initialization in which a maze starts mostly empty and variation operators fill in details while increasing fitness. Different representations are found to produce mazes with very different appearances, even when the same fitness function is used. The example fitness functions designed around dynamic programming with checkpoints are found to permit substantial control over the properties of the evolved mazes.},

In this context, search has almost always referred to selective search, as opposed to larger brute-force searches. The argument against brute-force search is that the state spaces of the games are almost always too large to be amenable for brute-force search. We believe, however, that brute-force search should not be too quickly dismissed. State spaces with trillions or tens of trillions states can now be exhaustively searched with relative ease, and growth in parallelism and computational power is expected to continue to scale this trend. We believe that this, combined with appropriate abstraction, will allow exhaustive search to be applied to many problems once thought to be prohibitively large. We explore this argument in the context of a game called "Fling!," available for mobile devices, showing a system for interactively designing and analyzing puzzles.},

The evolutionary algorithm evolves a tree structure, which encodes dungeons, aiming to generate levels close to the input configuration provided by a game designer. The tree structure holds information about the number of rooms, connections between them, and their position within a 2D map. The proposed encoding also allows evolving semantic information about the narrative of the game. This is done by feasibly setting keys and locks throughout the dungeons for locked door missions. The generated dungeons are then evaluated computationally and as a proof of concept using an adventure game prototype. A total of 70 players evaluated the contents and the results show that the procedurally generated levels are perceived as more human-made, fun, and difficult than their human-made counterparts for most cases.},

	abstract = {We present a framework to design collaborative games for team building that employs a search-based procedural content generation toolset to help designers creating levels. It comprises a multiplayer game with asymmetric interaction in which a player must reach the exit of a maze within a time limit, while wearing a head mounted display. The maze is complex and the player could not reach the exit on time without a team there to help her using a large number of printed maps describing candidate mazes. The player describes what she sees to the team who use such information to identify which one of the several available maps the player is currently navigating in virtual reality. Each game requires the generation of hundreds of very similar maps with several aliasing (confusing) situations but at the same time need to have a solution to guarantee that if the team members collaborate effectively they can guide the player to the exit. It would be infeasible for a human designer to provide such a massive number of maps for every game played. Accordingly, we developed automatic authoring tools to help designers generate such large sets of maps and also to optimize them based on design principles focusing on fun and pace. Our preliminary results show that the authoring pipeline we created can generate games (set of maps) adherent to such design principles.},

While GAN generated levels are stylistically similar to human-authored examples, human designers often want to explore the generative design space of GANs to extract interesting levels. However, human designers find latent vectors opaque and would rather explore along dimensions the designer specifies, such as number of enemies or obstacles. We propose using state-of-the-art quality diversity algorithms designed to optimize continuous spaces, i.e. MAP-Elites with a directional variation operator and Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites, to efficiently explore the latent space of a GAN to extract levels that vary across a set of specified gameplay measures. In the benchmark domain of Super Mario Bros, we demonstrate how designers may specify gameplay measures to our system and extract high-quality (playable) levels with a diverse range of level mechanics, while still maintaining stylistic similarity to human authored examples. An online user study shows how the different mechanics of the automatically generated levels affect subjective ratings of their perceived difficulty and appearance.},

In particular, GAN output does not scale to arbitrary dimensions, and there is no obvious way of combining multiple GAN outputs into a cohesive whole, which would be useful in many areas, such as the generation of video game levels. Game levels often consist of several segments, sometimes repeated directly or with variation, organized into an engaging pattern. Such patterns can be produced with Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs). Specifically, a CPPN can define latent vector GAN inputs as a function of geometry, which provides a way to organize level segments output by a GAN into a complete level. This new CPPN2GAN approach is validated in both Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda. Specifically, divergent search via MAP-Elites demonstrates that CPPN2GAN can better cover the space of possible levels. The layouts of the resulting levels are also more cohesive and aesthetically consistent.},

We trained two GANs: one using plain level images, one using both the images and some of the features extracted during the preliminary analysis. We used the two networks to generate new levels and compared the results to assess whether the network trained using also the topological features could generate levels more similar to human-designed ones.

Interestingly, a GAN trained on only 20 levels generated the largest set of diverse beatable levels while a GAN trained on 150 levels generated the smallest set of diverse beatable levels, thus challenging the notion that more is always better when training GANs.},

Here we use tile-patterns of various sizes as features. When using the measure for evolution-based level generation, we demonstrate that the choice of variation operator is critical in order to provide an efficient search process, and introduce a novel convolutional mutation operator to facilitate this. We compare the results with alternative generators, including evolving in the latent space of generative adversarial networks, and Wave Function Collapse. The results clearly show the proposed method to provide competitive performance, providing reasonable quality results with very fast training and reasonably fast generation.},

We use constrained evolutionary algorithms and quality-diversity algorithms to generate small sections of Super Mario Bros levels called scenes, using three different simulation approaches: Limited Agents, Punishing Model, and Mechanics Dimensions. All three approaches are able to create scenes that give opportunity for a player to encounter or use targeted mechanics with different properties.

However, in the presence of unpredictable noise, the fitness and descriptor of the same solution can differ significantly from one evaluation to another, leading to uncertainty in the estimation of such values. Given the elitist nature of QD algorithms, they commonly end up with many degenerate solutions in such noisy settings. In this work, we introduce Archive Reproducibility Improvement Algorithm (ARIA); a plug-and-play approach that improves the reproducibility of the solutions present in an archive. We propose it as a separate optimization module, relying on natural evolution strategies, that can be executed on top of any QD algorithm. Our module mutates solutions to (1) optimize their probability of belonging to their niche, and (2) maximize their fitness. The performance of our method is evaluated on various tasks, including a classical optimization problem and two high-dimensional control tasks in simulated robotic environments. We show that our algorithm enhances the quality and descriptor space coverage of any given archive by at least 50\%.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown potential in qualitative tasks where clear objectives are lacking. However, its effectiveness is not fully realized when it is conceptualized merely as a tool to optimize average human preferences, especially in generative tasks that demand diverse model responses. Meanwhile, Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms excel at identifying diverse and high-quality solutions but often rely on manually crafted diversity metrics. This paper introduces Quality Diversity through Human Feedback (QDHF), a novel approach integrating human feedback into the QD framework. QDHF infers diversity metrics from human judgments of similarity among solutions, thereby enhancing the applicability and effectiveness of QD algorithms. Our empirical studies show that QDHF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in automatic diversity discovery and matches the efficacy of using manually crafted metrics for QD on standard benchmarks in robotics and reinforcement learning. Notably, in a latent space illumination task, QDHF substantially enhances the diversity in images generated by a diffusion model and was more favorably received in user studies. We conclude by analyzing QDHF's scalability and the quality of its derived diversity metrics, emphasizing its potential to improve exploration and diversity in complex, open-ended optimization tasks.

Quality diversity (QD) optimization algorithms, such as Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME), search for a collection of solutions that are both high-quality with respect to an objective and diverse with respect to specified measure functions. However, CMA-ME suffers from three major limitations highlighted by the QD community: prematurely abandoning the objective in favor of exploration, struggling to explore flat objectives, and having poor performance for low-resolution archives. We propose a new quality diversity algorithm, Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Annealing (CMA-MAE), that addresses all three limitations. We provide theoretical justifications for the new algorithm with respect to each limitation. Our theory informs our experiments, which support the theory and show that CMA-MAE achieves state-of-the-art performance and robustness.},

	abstract = {To provide an enjoyable gaming experience, game designers need to effectively manage the difficulty of game levels. Achieving the desired difficulty often requires numerous iterations and fine-tuning, which generally consumes a massive time. This thesis focuses on investigating the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into a procedural dungeon generation(PDG) technique to generate levels that meet specific target difficulty criteria. PDG is a subarea of procedural content generation(PCG). PCG refers to using computational methods to generate game content, and can significantly reduce the time and cost of game development by creating assets automatically. As a subfield, PDG focuses on automatic dungeon generation. However, it is hard to ensure the generated level fits the desired difficulty. Artificial intelligence(AI) can create AI players to estimate the difficulty of levels. Thus, this research aims to apply AI players to assist the PDG method to control the generated levels' difficulty. This study creates a level-generation approach for a custom game. The game developed for the study is called Hack Into Chess. It is a puzzle game that requires players to collect items on the map when some enemies chase them. The level-generation approach implements cellular automata to generate levels and optimizes the levels according to the performance of an AI player which is based on Monte Carlo tree search. The generated levels are tested by human players to collect gameplay data and actual experience data. Finally, the thesis analyzes the correlation between the performance of the AI player and human players, which shows the potential of doing playtesting and predicting players' behavior by AI. The thesis also trains a prediction model to estimate the weight of factors that influence difficulty. It also helps level designers to find suitable parameters for generating levels with the desired difficulty.},

Our results indicate that WFC-generated levels are high quality, follow the graph structures' constraints, and are generated faster than levels generated by depth-first search and genetic algorithms. WFC methods can also adapt to new system specifications, common in puzzle games, by changing only the data instead of the code. This increases the stability of content production based on procedural content generation since it relies on data rather than procedures. Furthermore, WFC methods increase the efficiency of the manual process of creating in-game puzzle levels, allowing game designers to complete more tasks in the same amount of time and create a wider variety of assets.},

We believe, however, that brute-force search should not be too quickly dismissed. State spaces with trillions or tens of trillions states can now be exhaustively searched with relative ease, and growth in parallelism and computational power is expected to continue to scale this trend. We believe that this, combined with appropriate abstraction, will allow exhaustive search to be applied to many problems once thought to be prohibitively large.

	abstract = {Procedural generation of puzzle games allows for more varied and diverse levels, which provides a better gaming experience. However, the generation based on deep-learning approaches is very challenging with this genre of games due to their inherent complexity relative to strict design rules and discrete components. In this work, we propose a framework that is composed of three main modules: a solver and two classifiers. Instances of Rush Hour are generated randomly and the solver aims to assess the playability of the generated levels by classifying solvable and unsolvable levels and by evaluating the difficulty of solvable levels. Two neural networks are used to improve the generation. One network is trained to differentiate between solvable and unsolvable levels and the other is trained to classify the difficulty of levels. The robustness of the framework is examined on 6 {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}) 6 and 7 {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}) 7 grid dimensions. The results obtained showed the effectiveness of our modules in generating interesting and various levels with four degrees of difficulty for the Rush Hour puzzle, where the classifier was able to quickly identify unsolvable levels. Our framework could be easily adapted and extended for procedurally generating other game genres, such as Platformer or RogueLike.KeywordsProcedural level generationDeep LearningPuzzle games},

Among those algorithms, the recently introduced Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME) algorithm proposes the concept of emitters, which uses a predefined heuristic to drive the algorithm's exploration. This algorithm was shown to outperform MAP-Elites, a popular QD algorithm that has demonstrated promising results in numerous applications. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Emitter MAP-Elites (ME-MAP-Elites), an algorithm that directly extends CMA-ME and improves its quality, diversity and data efficiency. It leverages the diversity of a heterogeneous set of emitters, in which each emitter type improves the optimisation process in different ways. A bandit algorithm dynamically finds the best selection of emitters depending on the current situation. We evaluate the performance of ME-MAP-Elites on six tasks, ranging from standard optimisation problems (in 100 dimensions) to complex locomotion tasks in robotics. Our comparisons against CMA-ME and MAP-Elites show that ME-MAP-Elites is faster at providing collections of solutions that are significantly more diverse and higher performing. Moreover, in cases where no fruitful synergy can be found between the different emitters, ME-MAP-Elites is equivalent to the best of the compared algorithms.},

Puzzles constitute an effective technique for improving gameplay by offering players interesting problems to solve, but the use of PCG for generating puzzles has been limited compared with its use for other game elements, and efforts have focused mainly on games that are strictly puzzle games, rather than creating puzzles to be incorporated into other genres. Nevertheless, a significant body of work exists, which allows puzzles of different types to be generated algorithmically, and there is scope for much more research into this area. This paper presents a detailed survey of existing work in PCG for puzzles, reviewing 32 methods within 11 categories of puzzles. For the purpose of analysis, this paper identifies a total of seven salient characteristics related to the methods, which are used to show commonalities and differences between techniques and to chart promising areas for future research.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a rise in the popularity of quality diversity (QD) optimization, a branch of optimization that seeks to find a collection of diverse, high-performing solutions to a given problem. To grow further, we believe the QD community faces two challenges: developing a framework to represent the field's growing array of algorithms, and implementing that framework in software that supports a range of researchers and practitioners. To address these challenges, we have developed pyribs, a library built on a highly modular conceptual QD framework. By replacing components in the conceptual framework, and hence in pyribs, users can compose algorithms from across the QD literature; equally important, they can identify unexplored algorithm variations. Furthermore, pyribs makes this framework simple, flexible, and accessible, with a user-friendly API supported by extensive documentation and tutorials. This paper overviews the creation of pyribs, focusing on the conceptual framework that it implements and the design principles that have guided the library's development.},

However, current methods often only modify a limited set of game features such as the difficulty of the opponents, or the availability of resources. Other approaches, such as experience-driven Procedural Content Generation (PCG), can generate complete levels with desired properties such as levels that are neither too hard nor too easy, but require many iterations. This paper presents a method that can generate and search for complete levels with a specific target difficulty in only a few trials. This advance is enabled by through an Intelligent Trial-and-Error algorithm, originally developed to allow robots to adapt quickly. Our algorithm first creates a large variety of different levels that vary across predefined dimensions such as leniency or map coverage. The performance of an AI playing agent on these maps gives a proxy for how difficult the level would be for another AI agent (e.g. one that employs Monte Carlo Tree Search instead of Greedy Tree Search); using this information, a Bayesian Optimization procedure is deployed, updating the difficulty of the prior map to reflect the ability of the agent. The approach can reliably find levels with a specific target difficulty for a variety of planning agents in only a few trials, while maintaining an understanding of their skill landscape.},

	abstract = {Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms have been proposed to search for a large collection of both diverse and high-performing solutions instead of a single set of local optima. While early QD algorithms view the objective and descriptor functions as black-box functions, novel tools have been introduced to use gradient information to accelerate the search and improve overall performance of those algorithms over continuous input spaces. However a broad range of applications involve discrete spaces, such as drug discovery or image generation. Exploring those spaces is challenging as they are combinatorially large and gradients cannot be used in the same manner as in continuous spaces. We introduce map-elites with a Gradient-Informed Discrete Emitter (ME-GIDE), which extends QD optimisation with differentiable functions over discrete search spaces. ME-GIDE leverages the gradient information of the objective and descriptor functions with respect to its discrete inputs to propose gradient-informed updates that guide the search towards a diverse set of high quality solutions. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks including protein design and discrete latent space illumination and find that our method outperforms state-of-the-art QD algorithms in all benchmarks.},

During a design session, the user iteratively selects among presented alternatives and their selections affect the upcoming results. We aim to address two major concerns of interactive evolution: (a) the user must be presented with few alternatives, to reduce cognitive load; (b) presented alternatives should be diverse but similar to the previous user selection, to reduce user fatigue. To address these concerns, we implement a variation of the MAP-Elites algorithm where the presented alternatives are sampled from a small region (window) of the behavioral space. After a user selection, the window is centered on the selected individual's behavior characterization, evolution selects parents from within this window to produce offspring, and new alternatives are sampled. Essentially we define an adaptive system of local QD, where the user's selections guide the search towards specific regions of the behavioral space. The system is tested on the generation of architectural layouts, a constrained optimization task, leveraging QD through a two-archive approach. Results show that while global exploration is not as pronounced as in MAP-Elites, the system finds more appropriate solutions to the user's taste, based on experiments with controllable artificial users.},

They were initially applied to evolutionary robotics problems such as locomotion and maze navigation, but have yet to see widespread application. We argue that these algorithms are perfectly suited to the rich domain of video games, which contains many relevant problems with a multitude of successful strategies and often also multiple dimensions along which solutions can vary. This paper introduces a novel modification of the MAP-Elites algorithm called MAP-Elites with Sliding Boundaries (MESB) and applies it to the design and rebalancing of Hearthstone, a popular collectible card game chosen for its number of multidimensional behavior features relevant to particular styles of play. To avoid overpopulating cells with conflated behaviors, MESB slides the boundaries of cells based on the distribution of evolved individuals. Experiments in this paper demonstrate the performance of MESB in Hearthstone. Results suggest MESB finds diverse ways of playing the game well along the selected behavioral dimensions. Further analysis of the evolved strategies reveals common patterns that recur across behavioral dimensions and explores how MESB can help rebalance the game.},

	abstract = {While evolutionary computation and evolutionary robotics take inspiration from nature, they have long focused mainly on problems of performance optimization. Yet evolution in nature can be interpreted as more nuanced than a process of simple optimization. In particular, natural evolution is a divergent search that optimizes locally within each niche as it simultaneously diversifies. This tendency to discover both quality and diversity at the same time differs from many of the conventional algorithms of machine learning, and also thereby suggests a different foundation for inferring the approach of greatest potential for evolutionary algorithms. In fact, several recent evolutionary algorithms called quality diversity (QD) algorithms(e.g. novelty search with local competition and MAP-Elites) have drawn inspiration from this more nuanced view, aiming to fill a space of possibilities with the best possible example of each type of achievable behavior. The result is a new class of algorithms that return an archive of diverse, high-quality behaviors in a single run. The aim in this paper is to study the application of QD algorithms in challenging environments (in particular complex mazes) to establish their best practices for ambitious domains in the future. In addition to providing insight into cases when QD succeeds and fails, a new approach is investigated that hybridizes multiple views of behaviors (called behavior characterizations) in the same run, which succeeds in overcoming some of the challenges associated with searching for QD with respect to a behavior characterization that is not necessarily sufficient for generating both quality and diversity at the same time.},

To efficiently generate NCAs, we train generators via Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME), a quality diversity algorithm which specializes in continuous search spaces. We apply our new method to generate level generators for several 2D tile-based games: a maze game, Sokoban, and Zelda. Our results show that CMA-ME can generate small NCAs that are diverse yet capable, often satisfying complex solvability criteria for deterministic agents. We compare against a Compositional Pattern-Producing Network (CPPN) baseline trained to produce diverse collections of generators and show that the NCA representation yields a better exploration of level-space.},

	abstract = {Quality-Diversity algorithms, such as MAP-Elites, are a branch of Evolutionary Computation generating collections of diverse and high-performing solutions, that have been successfully applied to a variety of domains and particularly in evolutionary robotics. However, MAP-Elites performs a divergent search based on random mutations originating from Genetic Algorithms, and thus, is limited to evolving populations of low-dimensional solutions. PGA-MAP-Elites overcomes this limitation by integrating a gradient-based variation operator inspired by Deep Reinforcement Learning which enables the evolution of large neural networks. Although high-performing in many environments, PGA-MAP-Elites fails on several tasks where the convergent search of the gradient-based operator does not direct mutations towards archive-improving solutions. In this work, we present two contributions: (1) we enhance the Policy Gradient variation operator with a descriptor-conditioned critic that improves the archive across the entire descriptor space, (2) we exploit the actor-critic training to learn a descriptor-conditioned policy at no additional cost, distilling the knowledge of the archive into one single versatile policy that can execute the entire range of behaviors contained in the archive. Our algorithm, DCG-MAP-Elites improves the QD score over PGA-MAP-Elites by 82\% on average, on a set of challenging locomotion tasks.},

	abstract = {Quality-Diversity optimization algorithms such as MAP-Elites, aim to generate collections of both diverse and high-performing solutions to an optimization problem. MAP-Elites has shown promising results in a variety of applications. In particular in evolutionary robotics tasks targeting the generation of behavioral repertoires that highlight the versatility of robots. However, for most robotics applications MAP-Elites is limited to using simple open-loop or low-dimensional controllers. Here we present Policy Gradient Assisted MAP-Elites (PGA-MAP-Elites), a novel algorithm that enables MAP-Elites to efficiently evolve large neural network controllers by introducing a gradient-based variation operator inspired by Deep Reinforcement Learning. This operator leverages gradient estimates obtained from a critic neural network to rapidly find higher-performing solutions and is paired with a traditional genetic variation to maintain a divergent search behavior. The synergy of these operators makes PGA-MAP-Elites an efficient yet powerful algorithm for finding diverse and high-performing behaviors. We evaluate our method on four different tasks for building behavioral repertoires that use deep neural network controllers. The results show that PGA-MAP-Elites significantly improves the quality of the generated repertoires compared to existing methods.},

	abstract = {We focus on the challenge of finding a diverse collection of quality solutions on complex continuous domains. While quality diver-sity (QD) algorithms like Novelty Search with Local Competition (NSLC) and MAP-Elites are designed to generate a diverse range of solutions, these algorithms require a large number of evaluations for exploration of continuous spaces. Meanwhile, variants of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) are among the best-performing derivative-free optimizers in single-objective continuous domains. This paper proposes a new QD algorithm called Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME). Our new algorithm combines the self-adaptation techniques of CMA-ES with archiving and mapping techniques for maintaining diversity in QD. Results from experiments based on standard continuous optimization benchmarks show that CMA-ME finds better-quality solutions than MAP-Elites; similarly, results on the strategic game Hearthstone show that CMA-ME finds both a higher overall quality and broader diversity of strategies than both CMA-ES and MAP-Elites. Overall, CMA-ME more than doubles the performance of MAP-Elites using standard QD performance metrics. These results suggest that QD algorithms augmented by operators from state-of-the-art optimization algorithms can yield high-performing methods for simultaneously exploring and optimizing continuous search spaces, with significant applications to design, testing, and reinforcement learning among other domains.},

Levels are represented using a domain-specific description language, and search in the space defined by this language is performed by a novel variant of the Map-Elites algorithm which incorporates a feasible- infeasible approach to constraint satisfaction. Simulation-based evaluation is used to gauge the fitness of levels, using an agent based on best-first search. The performance of the agent can be tuned according to the two dimensions of strategy and dexterity, making it possible to search for level configurations that require a specific combination of both. As far as we know, this paper describes the first generator for this game genre, and includes several algorithmic innovations.},

	abstract = {The recently introduced Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites) is an evolutionary algorithm capable of producing a large archive of diverse, high-performing solutions in a single run. It works by discretizing a continuous feature space into unique regions according to the desired discretization per dimension. While simple, this algorithm has a main drawback: it cannot scale to high-dimensional feature spaces since the number of regions increase exponentially with the number of dimensions. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing a simple extension of MAP-Elites that has a constant, pre-defined number of regions irrespective of the dimensionality of the feature space. Our main insight is that methods from computational geometry could partition a high-dimensional space into well-spread geometric regions. In particular, our algorithm uses a centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) to divide the feature space into a desired number of regions; it then places every generated individual in its closest region, replacing a less fit one if the region is already occupied. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new "CVT-MAP-Elites" algorithm in high-dimensional feature spaces through comparisons against MAP-Elites in maze navigation and hexapod locomotion tasks.},

	abstract = {Many fields use search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space to find high-performing solutions: chemists search through the space of molecules to discover new drugs; engineers search for stronger, cheaper, safer designs, scientists search for models that best explain data, etc. The goal of search algorithms has traditionally been to return the single highest-performing solution in a search space. Here we describe a new, fundamentally different type of algorithm that is more useful because it provides a holistic view of how high-performing solutions are distributed throughout a search space. It creates a map of high-performing solutions at each point in a space defined by dimensions of variation that a user gets to choose. This Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites) algorithm illuminates search spaces, allowing researchers to understand how interesting attributes of solutions combine to affect performance, either positively or, equally of interest, negatively. For example, a drug company may wish to understand how performance changes as the size of molecules and their cost-to-produce vary. MAP-Elites produces a large diversity of high-performing, yet qualitatively different solutions, which can be more helpful than a single, high-performing solution. Interestingly, because MAP-Elites explores more of the search space, it also tends to find a better overall solution than state-of-the-art search algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of this new algorithm in three different problem domains ranging from producing modular neural networks to designing simulated and real soft robots. Because MAP- Elites (1) illuminates the relationship between performance and dimensions of interest in solutions, (2) returns a set of high-performing, yet diverse solutions, and (3) improves finding a single, best solution, it will advance science and engineering.},

MCTS performs best in spaces where every action has a significant impact on the outcome of the search. In many domains, however, particularly single-player games, many actions have little impact on the outcome, which makes MCTS perform poorly without heuristic support. To address this deficiency in such sparse-impact search problems, we introduce MCTS with Reversibility Compression, or MCTS-R, which uses the notion of action reversibility to compress MCTS trees as they are constructed, without loss of information. This not only reduces the memory footprint of the search tree, but also accelerates search by preventing the duplication of already-explored states, and increasing the attention paid to significant actions. We show that our approach outperforms several comparable algorithms for solving sparse-impact search problems.},

	abstract = {We explore data-driven methods for gaining insight into the dynamics of a two-population genetic algorithm (GA), which has been effective in tests on constrained optimization problems. We track and compare one population of feasible solutions and another population of infeasible solutions. Feasible solutions are selected and bred to improve their objective function values. Infeasible solutions are selected and bred to reduce their constraint violations. Interbreeding between populations is completely indirect, that is, only through their offspring that happen to migrate to the other population. We introduce an empirical measure of distance, and apply it between individuals and between population centroids to monitor the progress of evolution. We find that the centroids of the two populations approach each other and stabilize. This is a valuable characterization of convergence. We find the infeasible population influences, and sometimes dominates, the genetic material of the optimum solution. Since the infeasible population is not evaluated by the objective function, it is free to explore boundary regions, where the optimum is likely to be found. Roughly speaking, the No Free Lunch theorems for optimization show that all blackbox algorithms (such as Genetic Algorithms) have the same average performance over the set of all problems. As such, our algorithm would, on average, be no better than random search or any other blackbox search method. However, we provide two general theorems that give conditions that render null the No Free Lunch results for the constrained optimization problem class we study. The approach taken here thereby escapes the No Free Lunch implications, per se.},

Further, quality-diversity (QD) algorithms have also become popular for generating varied game content by using evolution to explore a search space while focusing on both variety and quality. To reap the benefits of both these approaches, we present a level generation and game blending approach that combines the use of VAEs and QD algorithms. Specifically, we train VAEs on game levels and run the MAP-Elites QD algorithm using the learned latent space of the VAE as the search space. The latent space captures the properties of the games whose levels we want to generate and blend, while MAP-Elites searches this latent space to find a diverse set of levels optimizing a given objective such as playability. We test our method using models for 5 different platformer games as well as a blended domain spanning 3 of these games. We refer to using MAP-Elites for blending as Blend-Elites. Our results show that MAP-Elites in conjunction with VAEs enables the generation of a diverse set of playable levels not just for each individual game but also for the blended domain while illuminating game-specific regions of the blended latent space.},

On top of this, achieving distinct play-styles using a general algorithm without reducing playing strength is not trivial. In this paper, we propose Portfolio Monte Carlo Tree Search with Progressive Unpruning for playing a turn-based strategy game (Tribes) and show how it can be parameterized so a quality-diversity algorithm (MAP-Elites) is used to achieve different play-styles while keeping a competitive level of play.

	abstract = {A grand challenge in reinforcement learning is intelligent exploration, especially when rewards are sparse or deceptive. Two Atari games serve as benchmarks for such hard-exploration domains: Montezuma's Revenge and Pitfall. On both games, current RL algorithms perform poorly, even those with intrinsic motivation, which is the dominant method to improve performance on hard-exploration domains. To address this shortfall, we introduce a new algorithm called Go-Explore. It exploits the following principles: (1) remember previously visited states, (2) first return to a promising state (without exploration), then explore from it, and (3) solve simulated environments through any available means (including by introducing determinism), then robustify via imitation learning. The combined effect of these principles is a dramatic performance improvement on hard-exploration problems. On Montezuma's Revenge, Go-Explore scores a mean of over 43k points, almost 4 times the previous state of the art. Go-Explore can also harness human-provided domain knowledge and, when augmented with it, scores a mean of over 650k points on Montezuma's Revenge. Its max performance of nearly 18 million surpasses the human world record, meeting even the strictest definition of "superhuman" performance. On Pitfall, Go-Explore with domain knowledge is the first algorithm to score above zero. Its mean score of almost 60k points exceeds expert human performance. Because Go-Explore produces high-performing demonstrations automatically and cheaply, it also outperforms imitation learning work where humans provide solution demonstrations. Go-Explore opens up many new research directions into improving it and weaving its insights into current RL algorithms. It may also enable progress on previously unsolvable hard-exploration problems in many domains, especially those that harness a simulator during training (e.g. robotics).},

	abstract = {Imitation Learning (IL) is a machine learning approach to learn a policy from a dataset of demonstrations. IL can be useful to kick-start learning before applying reinforcement learning (RL) but it can also be useful on its own, e.g. to learn to imitate human players in video games. However, a major limitation of current IL approaches is that they learn only a single "average" policy based on a dataset that possibly contains demonstrations of numerous different types of behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Behavioral Repertoire Imitation Learning (BRIL) that instead learns a repertoire of behaviors from a set of demonstrations by augmenting the state-action pairs with behavioral descriptions. The outcome of this approach is a single neural network policy conditioned on a behavior description that can be precisely modulated. We apply this approach to train a policy on 7,777 human replays to perform build-order planning in StarCraft II. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to construct a low-dimensional behavioral space from the high-dimensional army unit composition of each demonstration. The results demonstrate that the learned policy can be effectively manipulated to express distinct behaviors. Additionally, by applying the UCB1 algorithm, we are able to adapt the behavior of the policy - in-between games - to reach a performance beyond that of the traditional IL baseline approach.},

This paper surveys the literature on room segmentation and provides four publicly available implementations of popular methods, which target the semantic mapping domain and are tuned to yield segmentations into complete rooms. In an attempt to provide new users of such technologies guidance in the choice of map segmentation algorithm, those methods are compared qualitatively and quantitatively using several criteria.

We see how these structures can enhance segmentation processes such as region growing or watershed transformation. The principal advantage of these structures is that they give more weight to the adjacency relationships between regions than the usual methods. We note, nevertheless, that this advantage leads the adjustment of more parameters than other methods to best refine the result of the segmentation. We show that this adjustment is necessarily image dependent and observer dependent.},

One solution to this challenge is to schedule available professionals for demanding tasks while relieving them from simpler activities which are transferred to a robotic cleaning assistant. Two of such tasks are floor cleaning and waste disposal which account for 70\% of the daily cleaning efforts. This paper presents the world's first autonomous cleaning robot prototype that masters both of these tasks and whose development was accompanied by the advice of a large cleaning company. Besides a detailed description of the overall system and its individual components an evaluation is provided based on real world experiments. The results indicate that both cleaning tasks can be solved at high quality but with potential for increased efficiency to meet the required performance. Hence, the paper concludes with a discussion on measures necessary for the development of a commercial prototype.},

This paper presents a novel approach to provide live generation of levels for such multiplayer maps through procedural content generation and interactive evolution. The approach is demonstrated in the FPSEvolver video game that aims at replicating the look and feel of popular games like Counter-Strike. Without leaving the game a group of players can generate, play and improve levels to fit their particular preferences by voting on a selection of evolving levels. This approach focuses on maintaining the level design principles for modern first-person shooters that encourages good engagements between players, in the popular game mode “bomb defusal”. The presented approach can generate enjoyable maps that adapt to the preferences of players across a range of skill levels. Several distinct types of levels were created during testing, which range from open to closed, and complex to simple, each fitting closely with what the different players consider a good map.},

The research explores whether genetic algorithms have the ability to produce outcomes that demonstrate characteristics that arise through human creativity, and whether these automated approaches offer any benefits in terms of time and effort involved in the design process. The approach is compared to a random method and the results show that the genetic algorithm is more consistent in finding levels; however analysis of the game levels indicates that the fitness function is not fully capturing level playability. The ability to produce playable levels decreases as the play area increases, however there is potential to produce larger maps that are both playable and arguably creative through a recombination method.},

A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is used for searching the space of maps for candidates that satisfy pairs of these objectives. As the objectives are inherently partially conflicting, the algorithm generates Pareto fronts showing how these objectives can be balanced. Such fronts are argued to be a valuable tool for designers looking to balance various design needs. Choosing appropriate points (manually or automatically) on the Pareto fronts, maps can be found that exhibit good map design according to specified criteria, and could either be used directly in e.g. an RTS game or form the basis for further human design.},

	abstract = {In the conceptional phases of design optimization tasks it is required to find new innovative solutions to a given problem. Although evolutionary algorithms are suitable methods to this problem, the search of a wide range of the solution space in order to identify novel concepts is mainly driven by random processes and is therefore a demanding task, especially for high dimensional problems. To improve the exploration of the design space additional criteria are proposed in the presented work which do not evaluate solely the quality of a solution but give an estimation of the probability to find alternative optima. To realize these criteria, concepts of novelty and interestingness are employed. Experiments on test functions show that these novelty guided evolution strategies identify multiple optima and demonstrate a switching between states of exploration and exploitation. With this we are able to provide first steps towards an alternative search algorithm for multi-modal functions and the search during conceptual design phases.},

@article{lehman_exploiting_2008,
	title = {Exploiting open-endedness to solve problems through the search for novelty},
	abstract = {This paper establishes a link between the challenge of solv-ing highly ambitious problems in machine learning and the goal of reproducing the dynamics of open-ended evolution in artificial life. A major problem with the objective function in machine learning is that through deception it may actu-ally prevent the objective from being reached. In a similar way, selection in evolution may sometimes act to discourage increasing complexity. This paper proposes a single idea that both overcomes the obstacle of deception and suggests a sim-ple new approach to open-ended evolution: Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling a domain to cap-ture the open-endedness of natural evolution, the idea is to simply search for novelty. Even in an objective-based prob-lem, such novelty search ignores the objective and searches for behavioral novelty. Yet because many points in the search space collapse to the same point in behavior space, it turns out that the search for novelty is computationally feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behav-iors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. In fact, on the way up the ladder of complexity, the search is likely to encounter at least one solution. In this way, by de-coupling the idea of open-ended search from only artificial life worlds, the raw search for novelty can be applied to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the deceptive maze navigation task in this paper, novelty search significantly out-performs objective-based search, suggesting a surprising new approach to machine learning.},

	abstract = {Why evolvability appears to have increased over evolutionary time is an important unresolved biological question. Unlike most candidate explanations, this paper proposes that increasing evolvability can result without any pressure to adapt. The insight is that if evolvability is heritable, then an unbiased drifting process across genotypes can still create a distribution of phenotypes biased towards evolvability, because evolvable organisms diffuse more quickly through the space of possible phenotypes. Furthermore, because phenotypic divergence often correlates with founding niches, niche founders may on average be more evolvable, which through population growth provides a genotypic bias towards evolvability. Interestingly, the combination of these two mechanisms can lead to increasing evolvability without any pressure to out-compete other organisms, as demonstrated through experiments with a series of simulated models. Thus rather than from pressure to adapt, evolvability may inevitably result from any drift through genotypic space combined with evolution's passive tendency to accumulate niches.},

	title = {Evolving a diversity of creatures through novelty search and local competition},
	doi = {10.1145/2001576.2001606},
	abstract = {An ambitious challenge in artificial life is to craft an evolutionary process that discovers a wide diversity of well-adapted virtual creatures within a single run. Unlike in nature, evolving creatures in virtual worlds tend to converge to a single morphology because selection therein greedily rewards the morphology that is easiest to exploit. However, novelty search, a technique that explicitly rewards diverging, can potentially mitigate such convergence. Thus in this paper an existing creature evolution platform is extended with multi-objective search that balances drives for both novelty and performance. However, there are different ways to combine performance-driven search and novelty search. The suggested approach is to provide evolution with both a novelty objective that encourages diverse morphologies and a local competition objective that rewards individuals outperforming those most similar in morphology. The results in an experiment evolving locomoting virtual creatures show that novelty search with local competition discovers more functional morphological diversity within a single run than models with global competition, which are more predisposed to converge. The conclusions are that novelty search with local competition may complement recent advances in evolving virtual creatures and may in general be a principled approach to combining novelty search with pressure to achieve.},

	doi = {10.1145/3205455.3205602},
	abstract = {Evolution has produced an astonishing diversity of species, each filling a different niche. Algorithms like MAP-Elites mimic this divergent evolutionary process to find a set of behaviorally diverse but high-performing solutions, called the elites. Our key insight is that species in nature often share a surprisingly large part of their genome, in spite of occupying very different niches; similarly, the elites are likely to be concentrated in a specific "elite hypervolume" whose shape is defined by their common features. In this paper, we first introduce the elite hypervolume concept and propose two metrics to characterize it: the genotypic spread and the genotypic similarity. We then introduce a new variation operator, called "directional variation", that exploits interspecies (or inter-elites) correlations to accelerate the MAP-Elites algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this operator in three problems (a toy function, a redundant robotic arm, and a hexapod robot).},

In 2014, The General Video Game AI (GVGAI) competition framework was created and released with the purpose of providing researchers a common open-source and easy to use platform for testing their AI methods with potentially infinity of games created using Video Game Description Language (VGDL). The framework has been expanded into several tracks during the last few years to meet the demand of different research directions. The agents are required either to play multiple unknown games with or without access to game simulations, or to design new game levels or rules. This survey paper presents the VGDL, the GVGAI framework, existing tracks, and reviews the wide use of GVGAI framework in research, education and competitions five years after its birth. A future plan of framework improvements is also described.},

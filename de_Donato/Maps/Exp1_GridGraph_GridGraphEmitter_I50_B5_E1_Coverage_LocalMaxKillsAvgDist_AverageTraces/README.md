Here we optimized the coverage of the map while exploring the average distance between local maxima of Kills perfomed by the bots, and the average length of the kills traces, but using grid graph.

Exploration is more successful, in the sense that, for the same number of maps explored, Grid Graph shows that it is able to achieve more varied outcomes. However, many spots are left unfilled and many sport minimum fitness (meaning the map generated is too small to be of any interest).

Regarding the maps, I have selected some standouts that mainly illustrate how, despite finding maps that sport the selected features, most maps look unintresting. This is all the more evident when scrolling through the "Maps" folder.
